Assessment Task: Laravel User Signup Application

Overview:
You are tasked with creating a Laravel application that simulates user signup functionality, including storing user data into a database and sending a verification email to the user through a queue job. You are also required to create proper unit and feature tests to ensure that the application works as expected.

Requirements:

Create a new Laravel application with the following requirements:

Implement a user signup form that captures the following fields: name, email, password.
Store user information into a MySQL database.
Implement a queue job that sends a verification email to the user's email address.
Use Laravel's built-in email and queue functionality.
Implement validation rules for each field on the signup form.

Create the following unit tests:

Test that a new user can be created and saved to the database.
Test that validation rules on the signup form work as expected.
Test that the queue job is dispatched when a new user is created.
Test that the verification email is sent to the user's email address.

Create the following feature tests:

Test that a user can successfully sign up and receive a verification email.
Test that an error is displayed when validation rules on the signup form are not met.
Test that the user can successfully verify their email address.
Document the Laravel application and tests thoroughly, including setup and usage instructions.

The QA developer should create both unit and feature tests for the user signup functionality. PHPUnit and PEST are two popular testing frameworks that can be used for this purpose.

Deliverables:
The completed Laravel application with all required functionality and tests.
A detailed documentation file that includes instructions on how to set up and run the application and tests.

Timeframe:
You have three days to complete this assessment task. If you are unable to finish the task on time, please send us the project nonetheless so that we can review your progress.


This assessment task will allow the employer to evaluate the candidate's skills in Laravel development, database management, queuing systems, email functionality, validation rules, and testing using both unit and feature tests. The thorough documentation of the application and tests will also demonstrate the candidate's ability to clearly communicate and present their work.
